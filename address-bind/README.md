# address-bind

bind address in a offline wallet(for example Neuron) to address in web wallet.

## steps

1. generate bind info message.
    ```
    table BindInfo {
        from: Script,
        to: Script,
        timestamp: Uint64,
    }
    ```
2. serialize message and convert to hex string(no prefix `0x`).
3. sign hex string with Neuron.
4. compose message with signature.
    ```
    table BindInfoWithSig {
        bind_info: BindInfo,
        sig: Bytes,
    }
    ```
5. use web wallet transfer some ckb to itself. put BindInfoWithSig in witness.
6. backend scan ckb tx, verify signature. if valid, record bind relationship in database. for same from address, bind info with later timestamp will update bind relationship. if not valid, throw error.
7. frontend query bind relationship from backend. if bind relationship exists, show bind info. if not, show bind form.

## frontend

test in playground https://live.ckbccc.com/

generate bind info:
1. generate bind info message.
2. serialize message and convert to hex string(no prefix `0x`).
3. print this hex string.

bind address:
1. connect web wallet.
2. user input bind info message.
3. user input signature.
4. compose BindInfoWithSig.
5. use web wallet transfer some ckb to itself with BindInfoWithSig in witness.

## backend

scanner:
1. scan ckb tx. filter bind address tx.
2. for each bind address tx, verify signature in BindInfoWithSig.
3. if valid, record bind relationship in database. for same from address, bind info with later timestamp will update bind relationship. if not valid, throw error.

api:
1. query bind relationship by from address.
2. query bind relationship by to address.
